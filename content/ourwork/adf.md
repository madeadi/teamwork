ADF is a Singapore-based startup in the advertising space. Upon 4 months of the launch, it gathers more than 100,000 users and 13,000 active users daily. Using ADF apps, users can watch ads, play games to earn points, and exchange the points to rewards. 
We helped the client to conceptualise, develop the product, and maintaining the infrastructure which we deployed on AWS. We use React Native for the mobile apps and Laravel for the web server. For the servers, we design them such that it can grow/shrink based on the traffic.

We also deploy a Business Intelligence (BI) tool so that the ADF marketing team can create beautiful dashboards and reports by making use the millions of data that the system gathers every day.
