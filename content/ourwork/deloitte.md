Deloitte is a global accounting and consultancy firm. We created an app for their Risk Advisory (RA) business unit in South-East Asia. With RA Connect mobile app, Deloitte’s RA employees can register for RA events, get in touch with other employees, and know the affairs in other countries. 
We helped the client to conceptualise, develop, and deploy the product into Microsoft Azure infra. We use React Native for the mobile apps and Laravel for the web server.
The app is equipped with Event Management module allowing event organisers to scan employee’s QR code to take attendance.
